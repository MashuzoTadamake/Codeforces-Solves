# Codeforces Solves

This repository contains my solutions to Codeforces problems.  
I mainly use it to track my progress, store my submissions, and look back at how my problem-solving evolves over time.

- **Language:** C++ (mostly)  
- **Platform:** [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com)  
- **Status:** Updated whenever I solve new problems

> Note: All solutions were written after the contests ended, following Codeforces rules.
